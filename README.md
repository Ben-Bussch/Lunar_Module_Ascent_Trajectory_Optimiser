# Lunar_Module_Ascent_Optimiser

This program was developed to optimise the trajectory of a rocket taking off from the moon, as to minimise fuel costs. It makes use of GEKKO's ipopt NLP solver to numerically optimise the trajectory the rocket must take to reach orbit around the moon. 

The numbers and parameters used are from the Apollo 11 mission, as to be able to compare the program results to real data, to check the validity of the model. Results from the code indicate the launch time of the LM from the lunar surface up to orbit should be around 445 seconds, which is a bit more than the real launch duration of the mission, given at 435 seconds according to NASA's offical website (https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo11.html). This is essentially due to the oversimplified assumption that the rocket launched into a circular orbit, which was not the case in the apollo 11 launch. This is why another branch to this project was developed, which can model launching into an eliptical orbit. This model returns a much closer launch time estimate of 434 seconds for the apollo 11 launch.   

Further information about sources for all the data, along with derivations of the governing equations and system dynamics, is given in the Lunar_Module_Trajectory_Optimisation.pdf file attached on the main page. There is a mistake in the original code attached to this document with the mass scalar, which is why the results are slightly off from those produced by the current iteration of the code. I still however decide to publish this document since the rest of all the underlying theory and derrivations made in it are still valid and useful to understanding the model created within the program. Also, the document was written as a school assessment, so apologies for the unconventional formating.
